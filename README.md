# Final Project:


## Task List

### 1. **Create a Comparison Table (Done)**
   - **Objective**: Develop a table to compare the performance of various models during the testing process.
   - **Metrics Included**:
     - **Mean**: The average confidence score.
     - **Standard Deviation**: The spread of confidence scores.
     - **99% Confidence Interval**: The range within which we can expect the true mean to lie.
     - **F1 Score**: A weighted average of precision and recall, important for classification tasks.
   - **Output**: A comprehensive table that summarizes the model's performance for each quantization method.

   **Key Function**: `compare_models`

### 2. **Utilize F2P Code**
   - **Objective**: Integrate and test the provided F2P (Fully Functioning Parameterized) code in the model quantization and evaluation process.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Modify and adapt the F2P code to handle different quantization methods.
     - Implement various F2P configurations like `F2P_li_h2`, `F2P_lr_h2`, `F2P_sr_h2`, `F2P_si_h2`.
     - Ensure smooth operation and correct application during model evaluation.

   **Key Function**: `quantize_model_switch`

### 3. **Work on Tests (e.g., fp_2)**
   - **Objective**: Design and implement test cases to validate functionality and accuracy of the model evaluation pipeline.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Develop test cases for various quantization methods to ensure correctness.
     - Verify the expected outputs for different models and quantization settings.
     - Handle edge cases such as empty datasets or missing labels.
   
   **Key Concepts**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge case handling.

### 4. **Understand the Outputs**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the behavior of the system and model outputs at different stages.
   - **Tasks**:
     - **System Behavior**: Analyze the behavior of the system at each step to detect patterns, anomalies, or any unexpected behavior.
     - **Single Layer Output**: Study the output of a simplified single-layer model or analyze the first layer in multi-layer models to understand its contributions.

   **Key Tools**: Visualization tools like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for exploring model predictions and system behavior.

### 5. **Dequantization and Validation**
   - **Objective**: Dequantize output values and compare them with the original high-precision outputs (FP64).
   - **Tasks**:
     - **Dequantization**: Convert the quantized values back to their original numerical form using dequantization methods.
     - **Validation**:
       - Measure deviations between the quantized output and the original modelâ€™s output using average relative error and maximum relative error.
       - Conduct a thorough review of results using text files for manual inspection.

   **Key Functions**: `dequantize_model`, `calculate_error_metrics`
