# Quantization and Debugging Process

This project focuses on implementing quantization techniques for a neural network model, debugging the effects of quantization, and enhancing the output debugging for better clarity. Below are the detailed steps of the process.

---

## 1. Refactor Quantization Logic **(DONE)**

- **Task Description**:  
  Unified the quantization logic by removing separate cases for `INT8` and `INT16`. Instead, we introduced a more flexible quantization method with a general "INT" type that takes `cntrSize` as a parameter. This allows quantization for both INT8 and INT16 based on the value of `cntrSize`.

- **Benefit**:  
  More flexibility and easier maintenance of quantization code.

## 2. Debugging & Validation

- **Task Description**:  
  We simplified the debugging process by quantizing only the first layer’s weights initially. This allows us to track the impact of quantization on the first layer specifically and better understand the effect on the model output.

  - **Quantization with Distortion**:  
    Introduce a `delta` parameter to distort the weights slightly (e.g., +- 1%). This will help in understanding the effects of small changes in the model weights.

  - **Simple Models for Debugging**:  
    We will use simple models with 1-2 layers for debugging purposes, making it easier to track and validate the impact of quantization.

## 3. Enhance Output Debugging

- **Task Description**:  
  To enhance the debugging process, we will print important interim values, especially focusing on the outputs of the first layer when it is quantized. Additionally, we will structure the code to print only relevant and concise details. For example, instead of printing the entire output, we’ll focus on printing the key information such as:

  - `Idx: 347, Prob: 0.13%`

- **Benefit**:  
  This makes the output more readable and helps focus on key metrics during debugging.

## 4. Implementing `testQuantization()`

- **Task Description**:  
  Ensure that the `testQuantization()` function in `Quantizer.py` is clean and easy to understand. This function should print relevant results to the screen or to a file based on a debug flag. Additionally, it will check a few initial indices of the weights’ vector to assess how quantization is affecting the weights.

- **Benefit**:  
  Clear and efficient testing of quantization effects.

## 5. Pull Updates from GitHub **(DONE)**

- **Task Description**:  
  Make sure to pull the latest version of `Quantizer.py` from GitHub to incorporate recent fixes and updates. This ensures that you are working with the most recent changes, which may have an impact on your tests and implementation.

- **Benefit**:  
  Keeps the project up-to-date with the latest improvements and bug fixes.

---

## 6. General Advice for Debugging

- **Task Description**:  
  Work methodically and break down your debugging process step by step. Focus on printing only the most relevant information, which will help in understanding how the quantization is affecting the weights and model outputs. Avoid cluttering the logs with unnecessary details.

- **Benefit**:  
  More efficient and focused debugging process.

## 7. F2P: Implement the Variant Type of F2P

- **Task Description**:  
  Implement a variant type of the `F2P` quantization technique. This will involve ensuring that different `F2P` variants are correctly handled by the quantizer and incorporated into the quantization process.

- **Benefit**:  
  Adds flexibility to the quantization process and improves the robustness of the system.

---

## Conclusion

By following this structured approach, we ensure that the quantization logic is unified, debugging is streamlined, and the quantization process is both flexible and efficient. The next steps involve completing the `F2P` variant and continuing to test and refine the quantization methods.

**Note**: Tasks marked with **(DONE)** are completed, and you can focus on the remaining tasks to continue improving the quantization process.
